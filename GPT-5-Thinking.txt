1) Slant rhymes:

For slant rhymes, I don’t use a single branded “rhyme model.” I combine a few standard phonetic heuristics:

Pronunciation lookup

Get phonemes (ARPAbet/IPA) for the input word (e.g., from a CMU-style lexicon).

Handle multiple pronunciations if they exist.

Rime-focused similarity

Compare the rime (stressed vowel + following consonants) of the final syllable(s).

Give partial credit for matching just the vowel class (e.g., /oʊ/ vs /o/) or just the coda consonants (e.g., /nd/ vs /n/).

Feature-level scoring

Compute a weighted distance over phoneme features (place/manner/voicing for consonants; height/backness/rounding for vowels).

Reward: same vowel nucleus or closely related vowels; same (or similar) coda consonants.

Penalize: different stress pattern, extra/missing syllables, very different codas.

Backoffs & filters

If no close phonetic matches, allow assonance (vowel-only match) or consonance (coda-only match).

Light orthographic hints as a tie-breaker (useful for names/OOV words).

Ranking

Final score ≈ 0.6×rime similarity + 0.2×vowel-class similarity + 0.2×coda consonant similarity, with small penalties for syllable/stress mismatches.

That’s how I decide which words feel like “near rhymes” versus just loosely related in sound. If you want, I can show the top candidates for any word and explain why each one scores as a slant rhyme.

Example for finding slant rhymes for 'window':

1) Normalize & get pronunciation

Text: window

CMU-style phonemes: W IH1 N D OW0 (UK alt: /ˈwɪn.dəʊ/)

Notes: primary stress on WIN; final syllable -dow is /doʊ/ and unstressed.

2) Extract rhyme keys (with backoffs)

From the last stressed vowel onward (common rhyme practice):

Primary key (stressed tail): IH1 N D OW → think “/ɪn.doʊ/”

Backoffs (used for slant):

Vowel nucleus only: OW class (/oʊ/ ~ /əʊ/)

Coda similarity: allow D↔T, N↔M substitutions near the boundary

Syllabic scope: allow matches that end -do/-doe/-dough/-dow or that place /ɪn/ just before an /oʊ/ vowel across a word boundary (e.g., thin snow)

3) Generate candidate buckets

Use the keys to fan out candidates. Below I show what each bucket yields for window.

A) Word-final -do/-dow/-dough (ends in /doʊ/)

widow, kiddo, weirdo, Speedo, Meadow (proper), Lindo (proper), avocado (multi-syll; ends /doʊ/), tornado, crescendo, innuendo, Nintendo, Orlando, Fernando

B) Vowel-only /oʊ/ enders (assonance)

hello, below, solo, cello, pillow, willow, fellow, yellow, follow, halo, Rambo, banjo, mellow, cocoa (dialectal /ˈkoʊ.koʊ/)

C) Multi-word line-enders (cross-word /ɪn/…/oʊ/ echo)

thin snow, dim glow, rim low, brim low, back row, cold flow, slow go, wind blow, in tow, pin toe (playful), tin bow (near-nonce), skin show

4) Score (phonetics → prosody → fluency)

Illustrative scoring (0–1 per dimension; final ≈ 0.55Phon + 0.25Pros + 0.15Flu + 0.05Sem if you give a theme).
Here are a few worked examples:

Candidate	Why it fits	Phon (≈)	Pros (≈)	Flu (≈)	Final (≈)
widow	/ˈwɪd.oʊ/ shares -d.oʊ; onset differs (N/A)	0.88	0.8	0.9	0.86
kiddo	/ˈkɪd.oʊ/ same -d.oʊ, playful register	0.86	0.8	0.9	0.85
weirdo	/ˈwɪɚ.doʊ/ vowel shift in 1st syllable, same end	0.82	0.8	0.85	0.82
Orlando	/ɔrˈlæn.doʊ/ extra syllable, -doʊ end	0.78	0.6	0.8	0.75
crescendo	/krəˈʃɛn.doʊ/ stress mismatch, still ends -doʊ	0.76	0.55	0.8	0.72
thin snow	/θɪn snoʊ/: /ɪn/ + /oʊ/ across words (assonance)	0.7	0.85	0.9	0.78
in tow	exact OW nucleus; compact idiom	0.68	0.9	0.95	0.80
pillow	/ˈpɪ.loʊ/: vowel drift, coda mismatch	0.6	0.8	0.9	0.70

Takeaway: “-do/-doe/-dough” endings score highest; strong phrases like “thin snow” or “in tow” compete due to excellent prosody/fluency.

5) Filter by your constraints

Examples of quick filters you might apply:

Tone: playful (kiddo, weirdo), lyrical (willow, mellow), cinematic (Rambo, shadow)

Meter: prefer trochaic dimeter enders (e.g., widow) or iambic phrase ends (in tow)

Clean diction: avoid proper nouns if you need generic language

6) Produce labeled lists (by closeness)

Very close slant (shares -do/-doe sound):
widow, kiddo, weirdo, Speedo, meadow, Lindo, avocado, tornado, crescendo, innuendo, Nintendo, Orlando, Fernando

Solid slant (same final vowel /oʊ/):
hello, below, solo, cello, halo, follow, yellow, fellow, mellow, pillow, willow, banjo, Rambo

Two-word line-enders (great in verses):
in tow, thin snow, dim glow, rim low, brim low, back row, cold flow, slow go, wind blow, skin show

7) (Optional) Explain “why” for a few

widow: -d.oʊ matches -dow; initial syllable differs but stress/shape aligns → very close.

kiddo: same ending; consonant cluster /d/ retained → strong echo.

thin snow: /ɪn/ mirrors win, and /snoʊ/ mirrors /doʊ/—clean vowel echo across the boundary; great cadence.

in tow: exact /oʊ/ nucleus, ultra-idiomatic, snappy prosody for closures.

2) Multi word rhymes:

Here’s a clean, practical pipeline I’d use to find multi-word target rhymes (perfect + slant) for any input word.

1) Normalize & get pronunciation

Lowercase, strip punctuation.

Look up pronunciations (CMU dict–style). If OOV, run a G2P model.

Keep all pronunciations; multi-pron words can unlock extra rhymes.

2) Extract rhyme keys

For each pronunciation, find the primary stressed vowel in the last foot and take the rime (stressed vowel + tail consonants).

Build variants:

Exact key (perfect rhyme).

Backoffs: same vowel class, same coda, similar coda (feature distance), last 1–2 syllables.

3) Generate multi-word candidates

Use two streams and then merge:

A. Phrase templates (combinatorial)

Compose final tokens from frequent end-of-line patterns:

Adj + Noun (e.g., “thin snow”)

Det + Noun (“the window” for other inputs)

Noun + Noun (“brim low” counts phonetically like two words)

Verb + Particle (“in tow”, “fall slow”, “let go”)

Prep + Noun (“in tow”, “below” → single word but same sound family)

Adv + Verb (“slow go”)

Constrain the final syllable(s) to target the rhyme key or its backoffs.

B. Corpus search (retrieval)

Scan a corpus of n-grams (2–5 grams) and take those whose final word’s rime (or last two syllables) match the key/backoffs.

Keep phrases that are idiomatic or high-frequency to improve naturalness.

4) Score (multi-objective)

Compute a weighted score per candidate phrase:

Phonetic score (0–1)

0.6 × rime similarity (exact > same vowel+coda class > assonance/consonance)

0.2 × vowel class proximity (height/backness/rounding)

0.2 × coda similarity (place/manner/voicing features)

Prosody score (0–1)

Syllable count near the input’s tail (±1).

Stress compatibility (end-stress helps rhyming punch).

Optional meter fit (if you specify iambic, trochaic, etc.).

Fluency/Naturalness score (0–1)

Collocation frequency / idiomaticity (prefer “thin snow” over “wan sleet” unless you want rare).

POS plausibility at line end (avoid odd determiners or stranded preps unless stylistic).

Semantic/Topical bonus (0–0.2)

If you give a theme, boost phrases that fit it (e.g., winter imagery).

Final: 0.55*Phonetic + 0.25*Prosody + 0.15*Fluency + 0.05*Semantic

5) Deduplicate & diversify

Remove near-duplicates (“slow go” vs “go slow” if meter doesn’t require both).

Enforce variety across POS patterns and imagery buckets.

6) Perfect vs slant decision

Perfect: exact rime match (same stressed vowel + identical coda), stress aligned.

Near-perfect (very close slant): same vowel nucleus + coda differing by one phonetic feature (e.g., /nd/ vs /n/).

Slant: strong assonance or consonance, good prosody.

7) Practical guardrails

Prefer phrases whose final content word carries the rhyme (don’t end on weak function words unless the phrase is conventional: “in tow”).

For proper nouns, allow orthography tie-breakers but keep phonetics primary.

Keep multiple pronunciations for ambiguous words (“read,” “wind”).

Tiny worked example (target: window /ˈwɪn.doʊ/)

Rhyme keys: primary /ɪn.doʊ/ → backoffs: */ɪn.doʊ/, */ɪn.d/, */ɪn.oʊ/, */ɪm.doʊ/ (m~n slant), */ɪn.t̚oʊ/ (d~t slant), vowel-only */ɪn oʊ/

Perfect/near-perfect multi-word candidates

“in tow” (assonant + ending /oʊ/, compact, idiomatic)

“thin snow” (*/ɪn/ + /snoʊ/: strong assonance + near coda echo)

“wind blow” (semantic echo + /ɪn/…/bloʊ/; slant via assonance)

“dim glow”, “rim low”, “brim low”, “back row”, “cold flow”, “slow go”

You’d run them through the scoring above; “thin snow” and “in tow” usually rank highest for naturalness + phonetics.

If you want this automated

Lexicon/G2P: CMUdict + Phonetisaurus or g2p-en

Phoneme features: Panphon or custom feature table

Corpus: n-gram lists (e.g., COCA/Google Books/lyrics dumps) filtered to 2–5 grams

Syllabifier: CMU syllable markers or Sonority Sequencing fallback

Meter check (optional): simple stress pattern matcher over the last 2–4 syllables

I can run this for any word and return a ranked list with per-candidate phonetic/prosody explanations—and tailor it to your meter or mood.
