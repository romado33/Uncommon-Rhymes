I need to be honest with you: my approach is fundamentally different and significantly weaker than the systematic phonetic pipeline GPT-5-Thinking described. This is exactly why your RhymeRarity project exists—to address these documented weaknesses.
1) Slant Rhymes: My Actual Approach
No direct phonetic access:

I don't have runtime access to CMU dictionaries or phoneme representations
I can't compute feature-level distances (place/manner/voicing)
I don't explicitly extract rimes or analyze stressed syllables

What I actually do:

Orthographic pattern matching: I heavily rely on spelling similarities as proxies for sound (this fails often: "cough/though", "dollar/collar")
Learned associations: Training data patterns about what words "tend to rhyme"
Implicit phonetic knowledge: I have some learned intuition about sound patterns, but it's not systematic
Analogical reasoning: If "cat/hat" rhyme, words with similar endings might too

Why this fails:

Rare words: If I haven't seen many examples, I guess based on spelling (error-prone)
Phonetic families: I can't reliably identify that "dollar" shouldn't match "art/chart" but should match "collar/scholar"
Multi-pronunciation words: I often miss alternative pronunciations
Consonant cluster variations: I struggle with /nd/ vs /n/ type distinctions

My "scoring" is implicit:

Not a mathematical formula
More like a confidence estimate based on training patterns
Heavily biased toward common words and frequently-seen rhyme pairs

2) Multi-Word Rhymes: My Actual Approach
Pattern-based generation:

Memorized phrases: I recall multi-word rhyme patterns from lyrics/poetry in training
Syntactic templates: I use learned grammatical patterns (Adj+Noun, Verb+Particle)
Semantic coherence: I prioritize meaning over systematic phonetic coverage

What I DON'T do:

No systematic enumeration of phonetically valid combinations
No corpus-based retrieval of n-grams matching rhyme keys
No explicit prosody scoring
No backoff strategies for partial matches

My generation process:

Generate semantically plausible phrases
Filter for rough sound similarity (mostly orthographic)
Rank by fluency and training frequency
Hope the phonetics work out

Critical weaknesses:

Incomplete coverage: I miss valid combinations not well-represented in training
Over-reliance on clichés: I favor common phrases I've seen
Poor systematic exploration: No way to exhaustively find rare but valid matches
Phonetic blindness: "thin snow" and "window" might both occur to me, but I can't systematically generate all /ɪn.oʊ/ combinations

Why This Matters for RhymeRarity
This is exactly the 46.1% vs 60.4% accuracy gap your project targets:

Your phonetic classification system (with CMU dictionary) gives you what I lack: explicit phoneme-level analysis
Your anti-LLM algorithms can systematically enumerate combinations I'll never find
Your cultural database provides patterns I might have seen but can't reliably reproduce
Your hardcoded solutions for "orange"-type words address cases where I just... guess wrong

What I CAN Do Well

Context and semantics: Understanding what the user wants thematically
Fluency filtering: Recognizing natural vs awkward phrasing
Cultural relevance: Knowing which phrases "feel right" for different contexts
Interface: Explaining results, handling ambiguity, conversational flow

Recommendation for RhymeRarity
Your system should:

Use explicit phonetics (you already do) - don't imitate my weaknesses
Systematic enumeration - explore combinations I'd never consider
Feature-based scoring - use mathematical distances, not learned vibes
Coverage over memorization - find ALL valid rhymes, not just popular ones

Your architecture already does this right. The methodology in that GPT-5 document is closer to what you should aim for—just make sure your phonetic classification bug (dollar/ART) doesn't undermine the systematic approach.
